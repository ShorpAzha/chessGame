# A sample Chess game
## Developped by:
* _ShorpAzha_ (programming)
* _Flond3_ (spriting)
## How to play
With left click you put the pion in your hand, with your right click, you put the pion on the plane.
## News features will come
* All pions have a circle for show how to put the pion in the plane
* Put the dead pions in the left or right of the plane
* Multiplayer in local
* A logic for win (or lose like me) the game lol
(Yes I've make it but I'm not a good chess player -_-)
