With left click you put the pion in your hand, with your right click, you put the pion on the plane.
## News features will come
* All pions have a circle for show how to put the pion in the plane
* Put the dead pions in the left or right of the plane
* Multiplayer in local
* A logic for win (or lose like me) the game lol
